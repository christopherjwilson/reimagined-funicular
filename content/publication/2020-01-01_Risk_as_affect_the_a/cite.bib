  title = {Risk as affect: the affect heuristic in cybersecurity},
  abstract = {Risk perception is an important driver of netizens' (Internetusers') cybersecurity behaviours, with a number of factors influencingits formation. It has been argued that the affect heuristic can be asource of variation in generic risk perception. However, a majorshortcoming of the supporting research evidence for this assertion isthat the central construct, affect, has not been measured or analysed.Moreover, its influence in the cybersecurity domain has not yet beentested. The contribution of the research reported in this paper is thus:firstly, to test the affect heuristic while measuring its threeconstructs: affect, perceived risk and perceived benefit and, secondly,to test its impact in the cybersecurity domain. By means of twocarefully designed studies (N = 63 and N = 233), we provide evidence forthe influence of the affect heuristic on risk perception in thecybersecurity domain. We conclude by identifying directions for futureresearch into the role of affect and its impact on cybersecurity riskperception.},

She is Professor of Cyber Security at Abertay University in Dundee, Scotland. She was educated at the Universities of Pretoria, South Africa and Glasgow. Her research been funded by the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the Royal Society, the Royal Academy of Engineers and the Fulbright Commission. She is particularly interested in deploying behavioural science techniques to improve security behaviours, and in encouraging end-user privacy-preserving behaviours. Her research approach is multi-disciplinary, essentially learning from other, more established, fields and harnessing methods and techniques from other disciplines to understand and influence cyber security behaviours.
