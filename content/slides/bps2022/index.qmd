## Cognitive effects of financial distress

-   Financial distress detrimental to cognition [@vohs2013; @mani2020a] 

-   This can affect cognitive processes such as planning, reasoning and decision-making [@mani2013; @hofmann2012; @hinson2003; @roby2022; @debruijn2022].

- What's happening?

    - Need to attend to finances constantly 
    - Associated stress/anxiety is draining
    - Need to constantly exercise self control

::: notes
-   Need to attend to finances constantly / stress is draining
-   Payday effect - closer to payday = less money more resource needed to manage
-   Need to constantly exercise self control

## Self-control depletion and financial decisions

-   Self-control is a limited cognitive resource and exhausting that resource affects subsequent behaviour ["ego depletion" : @baumeister2014; @baumeister2018; @baumeister2008; @baumeister2006; @baumeister1998]

-   Self-control depletion might affect financial or risk-based decisions [@fischer2012a; @gerhardt2017; @koppel2019 ]

-   In the lab, a range of tasks have been used to elicit the effect, including those that target affect, attentional control, thought suppression or response inhibition. It has been replicated across labs [@hagger2016a; @hagger2010]

::: notes

One of the other ways this topichas been examined is through the lens of self-control ....

There is plenty of evidence of an effect, -- not specifically what the effect is


:::

## Self-control depletion and financial decisions

-   Debate about whether this is self-control, or general cognitive fatigue. [@inzlicht2014; @hagger2010]

- In the current research, inhibitory control tasks are also used (Stroop, Go-noGo)

- For the purposes of this research, we will refer use the term **Cognitive Exertion**

::: notes
Do the lab tasks (e.g. stroop response inhibition) exhaust a self-control resource or cause cognitive fatigue - I don't know - but for the purposes of this study it's fine either way
:::

## What is Construal?

-   Construal theory [@trope2003]: 

    - High-level construal =  thinking about goals in a more abstract sense such as why we are trying to achieve a goal
    - Low-level construal = thinking in more detail about the necessary steps to achieve a goal

-   Construal is both a cause and consequence of cognitive exertion effect [@bruyneel2012; @wan2011; @raue2015; @khenfer2017]

-    Construal might affect financial or risk-based decisions [@schmeichel2011; @ulkumen2011]

::: notes

If the effect of cognitive exertion, self-control exertion is inconsistent, what factors could the effect depend on?



... But why focus on construal?...
:::

## Much of the support offered to those in financial difficulty is knowledge focused

-   Financial literacy has been shown to increase knowledge and change intentions - but only sometimes examines behaviours [@amagir2018; @mandell2009; @kaiser2020]

-   The evidence on efficacy is mixed [@Luhrmann2015] and appears to be dependent on many contextual factors [@Meier2013; @Foster2015; @Chardon2016; @Alessie2013; @Henager2016; @Chen2018b; @Allgood2016b]

-   Could construal play a role - how information is construed affect subsequent behaviour?

::: notes
Contextual factors: including psychological traits/states (e.g. self-control, presentation format, age)

Could construal play a role? - how instructions are perceived
:::

## The current research

-   There is research suggesting construal might moderate cognitive exertion effects [@krastev2020a].

-   However:
    -   Direct manipulation of construal is not common
    -   Lab manipulations of construal are often generic, as opposed to context specific
    -   There is a dearth of work examining neurological corrlates

## General Overview

-   In 2 lab-based studies, participants are exposed to cognitive exertion task(s), followed by a financial decision task where each trial is preceded by a construal cue (low/high or control condition)

Research Questions

-   Study 1: Does construal affect financial decision-making?

-   Study 2: Are there any neurological indicators that distinguish high- and low-construal?

## Financial decision task: Coin Toss Trials {visibility="hidden"}

-   n trials = 20

-   Expected value of trials calculated as:

    *value of gain \* probability of gain - value of loss \* probability of loss*

-   Expected value of trials: 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10

    ```{r out.width="50%"}

    knitr::include_graphics("img/screenshot_coinToss.png")
    ```

    ::: notes
    Logically, we would expect EV to predict likelihood of gambling
    :::

## Study 1: Design 

-   IV: construal level (High-Construal, Low-Construal and Control condition).

- N = 75

    | Condition         | n   |
    |-------------------|-----|
    | Control Condition | 26  |
    | High Construal    | 25  |
    | Low Construal     | 24  |


## Study 1: Procedure {.smaller}

```{r out.height="270px", out.width="1300px"}

knitr::include_graphics("img/construal_study1_seq.drawio.png")

```

-   Participants decisions on the coin-toss task were incentivised using a random lottery, where they could win money, based on their coin-toss decisions

- "Your choices in this task do matter"

::: notes
The stroop task required a 70% accuracy rate to progress and could be repeated up to 3 times before the study would end automatically

# Study 1: Results

## Mean trials gambled in each condition {visibility="hidden"}

```{r }

knitr::include_graphics("img/study1_meanGambled.png")

```

## Model 1: Does expected value predict likelihood of gambling?

-   The model was a significantly better fit than the null model ($χ^2(4) = 441.47, p < 0.01)$ , Pseudo $R^2$ (fixed effects) = 0.30

-   A significant likelihood of not gambling when expected value of the coin-toss was 0 and significant likelihood of gambling in trials with higher expected values than 0 (with the exception of the Expected Value at 2.5)

    ::: notes
    A mixed effects logistic regression model was fitted, with expected value as fixed effect and participants as random effect variables, respectively (R: glmer, biniomial).
    :::

## Model 2: Does construal condition predict likelihood of gambling?

-   Model 2 was a significantly better fit than Model 1 $(χ^2(2) = 10.60, p < 0.01)$ , $\delta$AIC = -6.6, Pseudo $R^2$ (fixed effects) = 0.32

-   Examination of the coefficients showed that both High Construal (β = -0.97, p \< 0.01) and Low Construal Conditions (β = -0.49, p \< 0.05) predicted likelihood of gambling.

    ::: notes
    -   A mixed effects logistic regression model was fitted, with expected value and construal condition as fixed effects and participants as random effect variables, respectively (R: glmer, biniomial).

    -   No interaction was between Expected Value and Construal Condition was present.
    :::

## Model 2: Comparison of EM-means between condition

```{r out.width="200%", fig.cap = "Pairwise comparison of the groups showed that High Construal was significantly different to the Control Condition"}

knitr::include_graphics("img/exp1_lsmeans.png")
```

## Model 3: Does self control predict likelihood of gambling?

-   Adding self control (BSCI score) did not have a significant effect on the model ($\delta$AIC = 1.23, p \> 0.05)

## Study 1 Discussion / Study 2 additions

-   There is an effect of construal - High Construal associated with lowest probability of "gambling" and Control condition the highest

-   Changes to Study 2:

    -   Additional cognitive extertion task (Go/NoGo) added
    -   Make construal more explicit by having participants write construal-level statements before each condition/block
    - Added measures of subjective numeracy and financial literacy

    ::: notes
     - e.g., "Write down 5 reasons WHY you would save money"; "Write down 5 reasons HOW you would save money", "Write down 5 things you van see in the room"
    :::

## Study 2: Research Questions

-   Do the behavioural results replicate from Study 1?

-   Are there different patterns of neurological activation associated with high- and low-construal conditions?


## Study 2: Design and Procedure

```{r out.height="270px", out.width="1300px"}

knitr::include_graphics("img/construal_study2_seq.png")

```

-   Within-groups design necessitated by fNIRS
-   Planned N = 33

## Study 2: fNIRS

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Markers sent via serial/usb to fNIRS for specified events

- Levels of hbO and hbR are calculated during certain time periods relative to baseline

::: notes

We are looking at the prefrontal cortex which has been shown to correlate with attention, perception, cognitive/mental load, financial economic decisions

::: 


# Study 2: current status

-   Current N = 13

-   No inferential analysis run yet

-   We can observe fNIRS patterns of activation

## fNIRS analysis - preprocessing 

-   Data analysed using a custom R script (will be available on Github)

-   Preprocessing to remove noise, movement artifacts etc:

    -   .1 Hz Lowpass filter (heartrate, respiration)

    -   Moving average filter (1.5s)

    -   Linear detrending

## fNIRS analysis - preprocessing

```{r fig.width=10,fig.height=11}
library(tidyverse)
testData <- read.csv("testData.csv")
p<- testData %>%
 pivot_longer(cols = c(nir_value, nir_value_pre_lp, nir_value_pre_SMAR, nir_value_pre_dt), names_to = "measure", values_to = "nir_value") %>%
filter(freq == 730) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = t, y = nir_value, colour = measure)) +
 geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(.~optode)

 plotly::ggplotly(p, width = 1200, height = 500)
```

## fNIRS analysis - block level analysis {.smaller}







```{r out.width="1000px", fig.cap="Looking at mean levels of activation across trial types (i.e. different construal conditions) for each participant"}

knitr::include_graphics("img/oxyPlot.png")

```





::: notes

Mean activation per trial type (block analysis) is common, for example in cognitive exertion / mental load studies

Inter block interval to allow return to baseline

- Construal cue provides 30sec window - fNIRS activation usually 5-7secs

:::

# Preliminary findings

## fNIRS analysis and financial decisions

- Previous studies have shown right DLPFC was found to be more deactivated under challenging risk decision making [@wanniarachchi2020]. 

- DLPFC hemodynamic signals reflected a subjective value signal, correlating positively with individual risk attitude [@holper2014]

-  Activation in prefrontal areas especially targeted during the experience of gains and losses [@holper2014]

- Changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) concentrations during the 5-second period right after the decision was made [@li2012]

## fNIRS: visualising activity - during construal cues {background-image="img/fnirs_results.png" background-size="100%" background-repeat="no-repeat"}

## Behavioural data: mean % gambled (block * condition)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

allDataPres <- read_csv("C:/Users/wilso/Documents/GitHub/fnirs_analysis/allData.csv")


allDataPres$condition <- as.factor(allDataPres$condition)
levels(allDataPres$condition) <- list(Control  = "cue1", High = "cue2", Low = "cue3")

allDataPres$block <- as.factor(allDataPres$block)

p1 <- allDataPres %>% 
  group_by(condition, block) %>% 
  summarise(gambled = sum(gambled)/length(gambled)*100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = gambled, fill = block, label = round(gambled, digits = 2))) +
  geom_col( position=position_dodge()) +
   geom_text(size = 4, position =position_dodge(1),vjust=-.5) 

p1 


```

There might be an effect of Block as well as Condition

# Discussion / conclusions

## Current status

- Study 1 shows an effect of construal on gambling decisions

- Study 2 preliminary data indicates possible differences in neurological activity between conditions - not yet tested

- A lot more data yet to include when Study 2 models are tested (financial literacy, numeracy etc.)

## Further work?

- Will continue to explore Cognitive Load / Exertion effects on financial decisions

- Looking at more complex / ecologically-valid decisions 

- Keep improving manipulations and manipulation checks
