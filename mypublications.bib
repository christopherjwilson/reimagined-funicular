The current paper describes two experiments on the transformation of avoidance response functions in accordance with the relational frames of coordination and opposition (Experiment 1) and comparison (Experiment 2). Following nonarbitrary pretraining and testing, subjects were exposed to a series of relational training tasks and tested for the formation of multiple stimulus relations of sameness, opposition, and more-than/less-than. Subjects were then exposed to an avoidance schedule in which one member of the relational network served as a discriminative stimulus for an avoidance response. Finally, subjects were exposed to a probe phase to assess the transformation of other members of the relational network by the avoidance functions. Subjects who showed evidence of avoidance conditioning also showed derived avoidance. The findings of the studies demonstrate the transformation of an avoidance response function in accordance with the relational frames of coordination, opposition, and comparison.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose: The traditional herbal supplements Panax ginseng and Ginkgo biloba are self-medicated by members of the general public and prescribed by healthcare professionals in some EU countries for numerous health complaints. Clinical evidence is mixed and mechanisms of action are not fully understood. There is clinical interest into the synergistic effects of combining both herbs. Methods: We systematically review the literature investigating the effects of combination treatments on physiological and psychological outcomes in humans. We identified all studies meeting inclusion criteria: (a) written in English; (b) peer-reviewed; (c) conducted in humans; (d) including either a proprietary Panax ginseng/Ginkgo biloba treatment or a study preparation containing both; (e) placebo-controlled; (f) utilizing standardized extracts. We critically discuss each trial; calculate standardized effect sizes where possible and provide recommendations for research design and analysis. Results: Eight studies were identified and all investigated a proprietary combination treatment, Gincosan \textregistered{} . Studies are of high quality and robust; however, practice effects, choice of statistical model, and reliance upon null-hypothesis significance testing hinder generalized estimates of effect. The most consistent results are benefits to aspects of the circulatory/cardiovascular system in patient populations and ``secondary memory'' performance in patient and healthy populations. Two studies demonstrate synergy in healthy populations following a single dose; however, synergy in patient populations and following repeated dosing has not yet been directly tested. Conclusions: A Panax ginseng and Ginkgo biloba combination treatment can improve aspects of physiological and cognitive function in humans; however, evidence for synergy requires further investigation and future research should directly investigate synergy following repeated dosing.},

  abstract = {The presence of a cue in the visual scene that orients attention can interfere with what we report to see. It has been suggested that this interference effect is affected by socially-relevant characteristics of the cue (social model of interference); for instance when attention is biased by the presence of a cue to whom a mental state is attributed (e.g. another person). This paper examines whether perceptual features of the cue, readily detected by visual processes (perceptual model of interference), are sufficient to elicit the interference effect. To compare the social and perceptual models of interference, an experiment was conducted which systematically manipulated the mental state attribution to the cue. The results show that interference persists even when a mental state is not attributed to the cue, and that perceptual expectations are sufficient to explain the reflexive attentional shift, thus supporting a perceptual model of interference.},

  abstract = {Interest in Reflexive Attentional Shift has intensified in recent years because the cueing of visual attention is commonly used as a developmental measure of perspective-taking ability and the ability to infer someone else's mental state. Reflexive Attentional Shift occurs when attention is oriented by the onset of a stimulus at a specific location (Posner, 1980). Attention can also be biased towards where another person (the Other) is looking and this can cause errors or slower responding when reporting what we see, if this is different from what the Other sees.This Special Issue is inspired by the fact that the results of recent research are consistently similar, but continued to be interpreted either considering the perceptual characteristics of the Other (non-mentalizing position) or the social characteristic of the Other (mentalizing or Altercentric intrusion position). The current Special Issue is open to submissions of previously unpublished experimental, prospective, extended articles and review papers on the following and related topics:Theory of mindSpontaneous Perspective takenAltercentric intrusionDirectional attentional cuesDot perspective task},

  abstract = {Risk perception is an important driver of netizens' (Internetusers') cybersecurity behaviours, with a number of factors influencingits formation. It has been argued that the affect heuristic can be asource of variation in generic risk perception. However, a majorshortcoming of the supporting research evidence for this assertion isthat the central construct, affect, has not been measured or analysed.Moreover, its influence in the cybersecurity domain has not yet beentested. The contribution of the research reported in this paper is thus:firstly, to test the affect heuristic while measuring its threeconstructs: affect, perceived risk and perceived benefit and, secondly,to test its impact in the cybersecurity domain. By means of twocarefully designed studies (N = 63 and N = 233), we provide evidence forthe influence of the affect heuristic on risk perception in thecybersecurity domain. We conclude by identifying directions for futureresearch into the role of affect and its impact on cybersecurity riskperception.},

  abstract = {Background: Construal level \textendash{} described simply as thinking about how (low construal) or why (high construal) something needs to be done \textendash{} has been shown to affect decision-making making. In the context of financial decisions, it has primarily been examined in the context of delayed gratification or long-term plans. However, there is evidence that construal interacts with cognitive load and can have a more influence on risk-related decisions. In addition, there is a death of work examining neurological correlates of construal in this context.  Objectives: to examine how low and high construal affect risk-taking in financial decisions and identify neurological indicators of construal.  Design: 2 experimental studies were conducted. In both, tasks were presented to increase cognitive load. Then, construal-related cues were presented prior to each trial in coin-toss gambling task. In experiment 2, fNIRs was used to measure frontal lobe activation during decision-making.  Results:  Using mixed-effects logistic regression, Experiment 1 showed that high-construal predicted significantly lower probability of gambling. Experiment 2 data are being analysed at the time of submission. Conclusion: The results of Experiment 1 show the impact of construal on immediate risk-related financial decisions. Experiment 2 will provide more information on how construal impacts the decision-making process.}

  abstract = {The process of transformation of stimulus functions as been examined extensively in the RFT literature. However, it is only recently that studies have been conducted to examine transformation of functions through hierarchical relations such as containment and belongingness. The few studies to date that have examined this process have found some evidence to support that transformation of stimulus functions does indeed take place in this context. However, some studies have found resultant patterns of framing to be unidirectional (properties transfer only from higher- to lower-order class members), while others have found bi-directional responding (properties transfer either from higher- to lower-order or from lower- to higher-order class members) in nature. The current talk outlines a series of experiments which aimed to examine this process. The results show distinct patterns of bi-directional responding from some participants and unidirectional responding from others. We discuss why this might have occurred.},
